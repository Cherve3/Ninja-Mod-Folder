Description
*************************************************
Equipped with ninja weapons and tools, sneak past all the strogg or murder them
swiftly and silently from the shadows with stealth attacks. If you get overwhelmed
use your tools to your advantage and get to safety.

Replaced weapons with a Katana, kunai, bow, grappling hook, rocks, and smoke bombs.
Expanded on stealth mechanics so you ar hidden in the shadows, double damage while
you are undiscovered, and alert everyone when you are detected.
